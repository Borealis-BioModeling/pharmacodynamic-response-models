empirical fitting of response data.

### Functions:

General response functions:
  * Concentration-Response
  * Dose-Response
  * Inhibitor-Response

Receptor occupation:
  * Hill-Langmuir equation

Receptor-response functions:
  * Hill equation
  * Clark equation

  * Del Castillo-Katz model
  * Three-parameter two-state model by Buchwald
  * Gaddum equation (competitive antagonist model)
