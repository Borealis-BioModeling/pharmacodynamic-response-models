Collection of pharmacodynamic response models, including concentration-response, inhibitor-response, and various receptor-response models that can be used for
empirical fitting of response data.

### Functions:

General response functions:
  * Concentration-Response
  * Dose-Response
  * Inhibitor-Response  

Receptor occupation:
  * Hill-Langmuir equation

Receptor-response functions:
  * Hill equation  
  * Clark equation
  * Operational model by Black and Leff
  * Del Castillo-Katz model
  * Three-parameter two-state model by Buchwald
  * Gaddum equation (competitive antagonist model)
  * noncompetitive antagonist model (Emax reduction)

 Other response functions:
  * CNiFERs-Response
